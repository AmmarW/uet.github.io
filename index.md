#### Libaas - An Augmented Reality Try-On Environment
- LIBAAS-Interactive shopping is a retail shopping based project, which includes 3D overlaying of clothing models over customers so that they can try on the clothing in virtual world without actually wearing them.
- Virtual try-on has received much attention recently due to complications during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
- We present an augmented reality environment for 3D virtual clothes try-on, with size recommendations that enables a user to visualize himself wearing virtual clothes while looking at a mirror display.

#### Smart Cricket Batting Coach App
- Cricket coaching is an extensive task and due to physical and monetary constraints, a significant amount of amateur players are left out and thus are incapable of succeeding in their batting careers.
- Our mobile app resolves this issue by introducting a smart coaching method entirely free of these constraints.
- Batting trials are recorded within the app and critical statistics are provided as a feedback mechanism.
- The entire batting posture is analyzed along with the bat trajectory and extensive results are provided based on a comparative analysis with renowned batsmen.

#### Bowling Action Validation using Marker-Based Motion Capture System
- Marker-based motion capture systems are limited by environmental and physical constraints thus making them impractical and expensive for small-scale applications.
- Currently, marker-less systems are being developed which are capable of capturing full-body motion at the fraction of a cost compared to traditional methods.
- We present a similar system developed using probabilistic approach, and validated against a state-of-the-art Qualisys motion capture system.
